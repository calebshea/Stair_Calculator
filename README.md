# Stair_Calculator
A simple problem to illustrate recursive and dynamic programming skills. Multi-threading and timing features were also included.

The problem goes like this...

You must calculate how many different ways there are to ascend a given number of stairs (for the sake of the integer, this is 0 to 36 stairs). You may only take 1, 2, or 3 stairs at a time. 0 stairs = 1 way.
